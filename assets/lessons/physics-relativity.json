  "content": "Einstein's theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. This groundbreaking theory consists of two parts: special relativity and general relativity, each with profound implications for our understanding of the universe.\n\nSpecial Relativity (1905):\n- Based on two fundamental principles:\n  1. The laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion\n  2. The speed of light in vacuum is constant for all observers\n- Key consequences:\n  * Time dilation: Time passes slower for objects moving at high speeds\n  * Length contraction: Objects appear shorter in the direction of motion\n  * Mass-energy equivalence: E = mc²\n  * Relativity of simultaneity: Events that appear simultaneous to one observer may not be to another\n\nGeneral Relativity (1915):\n- Einstein's theory of gravity\n- Key concepts:\n  * Gravity is not a force but a curvature of spacetime\n  * Mass and energy cause spacetime to curve\n  * Objects follow the shortest path in curved spacetime\n  * Time passes slower in stronger gravitational fields\n\nExperimental Confirmations:\n- Gravitational lensing of light\n- Precession of Mercury's orbit\n- Gravitational waves detection\n- GPS satellite time corrections\n- Gravitational redshift\n\nImpact and Applications:\n- Modern cosmology and understanding of the universe\n- GPS navigation systems\n- Black hole physics\n- Gravitational wave astronomy\n\nThe theory of relativity has been confirmed by numerous experiments and continues to be one of the most successful theories in physics, despite its counterintuitive nature.",
